#L4D2-Trial

##Goal
The goal of this project is to create a truly immersive realistic L4D2 experience that people who love realism in games can truly enjoy.

##Features
###Weapons And Ammunition Are Scarce
In L4D2 there are weapons everywhere. Players can freely choose what weapon they prefer and adapt to different situations however they want. In addition to this, a single weapon spawn can magically generate an unlimited amount of weapons that every player can pick up as many times as he wants!  
In this modification all weapons will be single pickup, and there will be a lot less of them around. Ammunition piles will have a limited amount of ammo with different amounts of ammo for each different kind of weapon.

###Carried Items Are Not Weightless
In L4D2 you move at the same speed and with the same ease regardless of how much stuff and what kind of stuff you're carrying.  
Every item, weapon and bullet will have a weight, and players will be progressively more encumbered the more weight they carry, leading to a slower movement speed when heavy, but also a higher speed when carrying few items.

###Amount Of Carried Gear Is Less Limited
In the game you are only allowed to carry at most 1 throwable, 1 small health item, 1 large health item, 1 side-arm, and 1 primary weapon.  
This doesn't make that much sense, so a possible feature will be the addition of a backpack of sorts, or some way of accessing alternate weapon sets, so that players can carry more of the gear that they find, though they will be punished by encumbrance.  
Note that players will be able to carry ammunition for weapons that they don't currently carry, which has an impact on other features!

###You Can Exchange Weapons And Ammo
You can't drop your weapon naturally in the game unless you pick another one up. You also cannot trade ammo with allies or drop ammo.  
This will be changed so that you are free to distribute weapons and ammo any way you like, including just ditching gear to be less encumbered.

###Noise Attracts Zombies 
When you shoot a gun, it makes loud noises. Yet zombies in L4D2 are deaf for the most part, only reacting if you're noisy within a few feet of them. This is silly!  
So the game will be changed so that each gun generates a certain amount of noise, and too much noise too close together calls the attention of a small zombie horde. If the noise continues, zombies will continue to join the mob. If you're too noisy taking care of the mob, you'll call even more zombies on yourself, leading to your eventual death (or to the death of every zombie within earshot).

###Lack Of Noise And Flashiness Does Not Attract Zombies
A common event in L4D2 is having an... well, an event, where you have to wait out for a bridge to lower or a gate to open or something of the sort while the infected swarm at your position. This makes sense in cases where there's a lot of noise and lights being emitted by the event object, but in many cases there is no noise or light!  
So only events that actually do attract attention will call swarms of undead, although there may be an increased chance of being attacked by special infected to make up for the decrease in difficulty on these events.

###Population Density Is Realistic
In L4D2 you somehow have a lot of zombies everywhere, whether you're in a rural setting, in the middle of god-forsaken woods, or in the middle of a once thriving metropolis. This makes no sense: there would not be as many people to be infected in a farm as in a city!  
So it is a goal to change this into a more logical distribution of infected.

###Pain-Pills and Adrenaline Have Side Effects
In the regular game you can take an endless supply of pain pills and everything will be okay. You just chug them, whole bottles at a time, and it gives you a health boost. This cannot be.  
Pain pills will have side effects, which will get worse and worse the more you take. Side effects will include auditory hallucinations, maybe visual ones if I find a way to do that, blurred vision, slowed movement/shooting/looking, taking damage at first before the pain pills take effect, and at some point death.  
Adrenaline will have a similar effect.

###Defibrillators Are Not A Cure To Death
In the regular game, you can just use a defibrillator to bring any player back to life, no matter what killed him or how long he's been dead. In real life defibrillators are only useful in case of tachycardia or fibrillation (or something like that, I've never studied the subject).  
This will be changed so that defibrillators are only used in situations where it would be logical for them to have an effect, and only for a short time after the player's game death. Defibrillators may end up being removed altogether though, we'll see after I've done more research into the subject.

###Death Is Permanent
In the regular game, people want to play, so even if you die on a map you will be reborn on the next one or rescued from a closet as if you were a different person!  
Once a player dies, he will be dead for good - assuming he can't be brought back through medicinal methods.

###Common Infected Might Have Useful Objects
Common infected were people too, many of them trying to survive this apocalypse: so it is only plausible that some of them might have had useful items with them when they were turned that are still on their body. This is especially the case for zombies from hospital settings, as well as riot guards (who should have more than just tonfas), army men, the passing's bikers and swamp fever's swamp people.  
The change is simple: cause them to have a small random chance of dropping something useful.

###Weapons Are Not Always Fully Loaded
Whenever you pick a gun up, it will have a full clip in it along with several other clips of ammo!  
This makes no sense, so weapons will have a fairly random amount of bullets in them, often none, and will very rarely have any extra clips with them!

###There Is No Ambience Music
There is no soundtrack to real life, so it obviously has to go!

###There Is No HUD
There is no HUD telling you information you should be able to tell from the situation: how much health you or your fellow survivors have, what items they're carrying, what weapons you have and how much ammo you have in them. Note that you will be notified of how much ammo you pick up each time you pick it up, and when going through your backpack you can determine how much ammo you have and whatnot.

###There Are No Magic Coloured Outlines
Just like the realism mutation, survivors do not have a magic outline and cannot be seen through walls. In addition to this, items also do not have any outlines.
