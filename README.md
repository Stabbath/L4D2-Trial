#L4D2-Trial

##Goal
The goal of this project is to create a truly immersive realistic L4D2 experience that people who love realism in games can truly enjoy. Might end up taking some inspiration from Holdout or other excellent mutations with interestin features.

##Features
###Weapons And Ammunition Are Scarce (And So Are Other Items)
In L4D2 there are weapons everywhere. Players can freely choose what weapon they prefer and adapt to different situations however they want. In addition to this, a single weapon spawn can magically generate an unlimited amount of weapons that every player can pick up as many times as he wants!  
In this modification all weapons will be single pickup, and there will be a lot less of them around. Ammunition piles will have a limited amount of ammo with different amounts of ammo for each different kind of weapon.
It does not make sense that there's so many items around either, especially in saferooms. If it's the apocalypse and there's other survivors, I'm fairly sure at least one of them would've been a jerk and would've looted all of the first aid kits, weapons and ammo. In fact, the 4 survivors that we play as are jerks! They always take all of the health items and whatever's available. You can't blame them for wanting to improve their own chances of survival, but as the graffiti on walls clearly proves, other people have been through those saferooms, and they wouldn't be leaving a plethora of utensils behind.
Another thing: static machine guns/miniguns never run out of ammo! They overheat, but ammo is unlimited. This is unrealistic.

###Carried Items Are Not Weightless
In L4D2 you move at the same speed and with the same ease regardless of how much stuff and what kind of stuff you're carrying.  
Every item, weapon and bullet will have a weight, and players will be progressively more encumbered the more weight they carry, leading to a slower movement speed when heavy, but also a higher speed when carrying few items.

###Amount Of Carried Gear Is Less Limited
In the game you are only allowed to carry at most 1 throwable, 1 small health item, 1 large health item, 1 side-arm, and 1 primary weapon.  
This doesn't make that much sense, so a possible feature will be the addition of a backpack of sorts, or some way of accessing alternate weapon sets, so that players can carry more of the gear that they find, though they will be punished by encumbrance.  
Note that players will be able to carry ammunition for weapons that they don't currently carry, which has an impact on other features!

###You Can Exchange Weapons And Ammo
You can't drop your weapon naturally in the game unless you pick another one up. You also cannot trade ammo with allies or drop ammo.  
This will be changed so that you are free to distribute weapons and ammo any way you like, including just ditching gear to be less encumbered.

###Gunfire Noise Attracts Zombies 
When you shoot a gun, it makes loud noises. Yet zombies in L4D2 are deaf for the most part, only reacting if you're noisy within a few feet of them. This is silly!  
So the game will be changed so that each gun generates a certain amount of noise, and too much noise too close together calls the attention of a small zombie horde. If the noise continues, zombies will continue to join the mob. If you're too noisy taking care of the mob, you'll call even more zombies on yourself, leading to your eventual death (or to the death of every zombie within earshot).

###Lack Of Noise And Flashiness Does Not Attract Zombies
A common event in L4D2 is having an... well, an event, where you have to wait out for a bridge to lower or a gate to open or something of the sort while the infected swarm at your position. This makes sense in cases where there's a lot of noise and lights being emitted by the event object, but in many cases there is no noise or light!  
So only events that actually do attract attention will call swarms of undead, although there may be an increased chance of being attacked by special infected to make up for the decrease in difficulty on these events.

###Population Density Is Realistic
In L4D2 you somehow have a lot of zombies everywhere, whether you're in a rural setting, in the middle of god-forsaken woods, or in the middle of a once thriving metropolis. This makes no sense: there would not be as many people to be infected in a farm as in a city!  
So it is a goal to change this into a more logical distribution of infected.

###Pain-Pills and Adrenaline Have Side Effects
In the regular game you can take an endless supply of pain pills and everything will be okay. You just chug them, whole bottles at a time, and it gives you a health boost. This cannot be.  
Pain pills will have side effects, which will get worse and worse the more you take. Side effects will include auditory hallucinations, maybe visual ones if I find a way to do that, blurred vision, slowed movement/shooting/looking, taking damage at first before the pain pills take effect, and at some point death.  
Adrenaline will have a similar effect.

###Defibrillators Are Not A Cure To Death
In the regular game, you can just use a defibrillator to bring any player back to life, no matter what killed him or how long he's been dead. In real life defibrillators are only useful in case of tachycardia or fibrillation (or something like that, I've never studied the subject).  
This will be changed so that defibrillators are only used in situations where it would be logical for them to have an effect, and only for a short time after the player's game death. Defibrillators may end up being removed altogether though, we'll see after I've done more research into the subject.

###Death Is Permanent
In the regular game, people want to play, so even if you die on a map you will be reborn on the next one or rescued from a closet as if you were a different person!  
Once a player dies, he will be dead for good - assuming he can't be brought back through medicinal methods.

###Common Infected Might Have Useful Objects
Common infected were people too, many of them trying to survive this apocalypse: so it is only plausible that some of them might have had useful items with them when they were turned that are still on their body. This is especially the case for zombies from hospital settings, as well as riot guards (who should have more than just tonfas), army men, the passing's bikers and swamp fever's swamp people.  
The change is simple: cause them to have a small random chance of dropping something useful.

###Weapons Are Not Always Fully Loaded
Whenever you pick a gun up, it will have a full clip in it along with several other clips of ammo!  
This makes no sense, so weapons will have a fairly random amount of bullets in them, often none, and will very rarely have any extra clips with them!

###There Is No Ambience Music
There is no soundtrack to real life, so it obviously has to go!

###There Is No HUD
There is no HUD telling you information you should be able to tell from the situation: how much health you or your fellow survivors have, what items they're carrying, what weapons you have and how much ammo you have in them. Note that you will be notified of how much ammo you pick up each time you pick it up, and when going through your backpack you can determine how much ammo you have and whatnot.

###There Are No Magic Coloured Outlines
Just like the realism mutation, survivors do not have a magic outline and cannot be seen through walls. In addition to this, items also do not have any outlines.

###As Time Passes By...
Unlike in the regular game, time will pass, leading to changes in the amount of light, possibly even until nightfall. While survivors will usually leave each saferoom at dawn and sleep in them by night for safety, if they take too long getting to the next saferoom they will find themselves shrouded in darkness.

###Dynamic Weather
In the regular game you usually have pretty normal unchanged weather: clear skies. In Hard Rain you get to have some rainy storms, but only in 1 or 2 maps. The hope is to have a reasonable degree of randomness in weather, perhaps even with flash rains in a single map that only last for half of it, or a growing fog that gets worse and worse with each map that's played through.

###Being Incapacitated Underwater Drowns You
To be fair, this already happens in the game, but it is insanely slow, taking maybe close to a minute to lead to death. That's not very realistic, so it needs changing.

###Survivors Do Not Say Silly Anti-Climactic Things
In L4D1 there was no real problem with this, but with L4D2 there's a tendency for survivors to be overly playful for someone who is stuck with 3 other people in a world with millions of zombies who want to kill you. It sometimes ruins the mood. So survivor chatter will be partially filtered to dispose of the worst offenders.

###There Are No Survivor Protection Mechanics
There are several mechanics in place to protect survivors from taking too much damage: one example is the invulnerability timer (aka 'godframes'). Another is the limit to the time after a common infected hit is registered before another one can register again. Hits during this interval will deal no damage and have no effect on the player. Also, common infected magically do half damage when attacking from behind: makes no sense.  
So all of these mechanics will be removed.

###Boomer Bile Is All-Consuming
In L4D2 boomer vomit will attract infected to people hit with it: yet if it comes from a vial thrown by survivors it doesn't cover survivors, and if it comes from a boomer it won't cover infected. This makes no sense.  
So the game will be changed so that all sources of bile cover all possible targets in it!

###Weapons Jam or Break
Sometimes it happens: weapons jam. If a weapon gets wet it won't usually work very well. Homemade pipe-bombs can fail, and molotovs won't ignite if the cloth is completely wet. Not all melee weapons would be unbreakable in real life. Shoving infected away with a weapon might slowly cause damage to that weapon. Things like these will be added.

###Melee Weapons Don't Make Mincemeat Out Of Zombies
A frying pan killing 4 infected with a single swipe? Really? That has to be changed.

###Survivors Are Not Fire-Retardant
In L4D2, infected will be ignited until they die or walk into water if they walk through fire. Survivors, however, somehow manage to be extinguished the second they walk out of the flames! This makes no sense, and needs fixing.

###Windows Don't Instantly Break
In L4D2 and possibly other more recent Source games, windows have a tendency to be broken just by having someone walk into them. This doesn't make much sense, like a lot of other things! Hopefully it can be remedied.

###Flashlights Run On Batteries
Unlike the regular game, flashlights will not have unlimited power!

###Taking Damage Can Actually Cause Damage
In this game, as in many others, "damage" is a virtual concept that affects a virtual loose representation of your "health." It is an intention to make the virtual damage you take do more than just alter your 'health': it may cause damage to your internal organs, or break bones, causing you to suffer more damage over time, be slowed down, have impaired reflexes and aiming ability, lose consciousness, etc. You might take extra damage each time you take a step if your leg is broken. Situations like taking fall damage, being viciously attacked by special infected or swarms of 
common infected, etc will be of special concern.

###Medkits Are Not A Quick Fix To An Unhealthy Life-Style
Instead of giving a free increase in health of 80% or whatever it is, medkits will still heal you, but a lot less. The main focus of medkits will be on curing special wounds like the kind mentioned in the point above.

###Special Infected Cannot Be Deadstopped
If a very-high-speed 70 kg former-man crashes against you, you're not going to be able to magically stop it with a shove.

###Chargers Cannot Be Leveled Without Consequences
Leveling chargers is alright, it makes some sense that an axe to the head would kill a zombie even if it's a large fast one, but if you're standing in front of it when you kill it, his corpse would smash against you and send you flying away! Expect consequences from leveling chargers face-to-face.

###Blunt Melee Weapons Can Stagger Targets

###Unrealistic Item Spawns Will Be Removed
Sometimes there's a weapon spawn in a place that doesn't make much sense, or a defibrillator on top of a bed in a kid's bedroom or something of the sort. These spawns will be progressively filtered and removed. Spawns that would make sense but aren't in the game may be added as well.

###Weapons Should Have More Recoil
Weapons should have a larger kickback than what is seen in game!

###Sprinting
As opposed to the game's normal shift-walk, nonshift-run way of doing things, the roles will be reversed: people will walk slowly by default, and be able to sprint with shift. It may be allowed for players to be able to both walk slowly and sprint in addition to the normal running, but in that case the speed for running will be changed: players will have slightly slower crouch, walk and run movement, and a slightly faster addition which will be sprinting.

###Fatigue
Related to the previous feature and many other subjects. Players will not be able to run all day or jump all day or shove infected away all day or swing melee weapons all day. They will be fatigued which will slow them down in everything they do, and if overworked may lead to exhaustion and other effects. The more encumbered they are, the more quickly they'll be fatigued. The more fatigued without going overboard, however, the more used to it they will be, and the higher their endurance will be in the future.

###Witch Will Not Be A Killing Machine
The witch is just a very sad zombie. She might have some seriously sharp claws, but if a hunter ravaging you won't kill you in 3 seconds, neither will being slashed by a witch a single time. Witches are also overly resistant to damage, considering they're just sad skinny emo zombies with no titanium-alloy plating over their skin. They will, however, be allowed to go after more than one player, since it doesn't make sense for her to freak out after a kill and run for the hills. She will also probably become angered more quickly.

###Tank Will Be A Killing Machine, But Stoppable
It makes sense for the tank to do a lot of damage: in fact, he doesn't do enough damage on coop on difficulties other than expert! He is a giant hulk, he should be able to kill/incapacitate people with only 1 or 2 hits. He should not however, take so long to kill when you don't have the best weapons or are missing a few teammates. His damage will be high, but his health will be reduced when compared to typical game modes.

###Realistic Friendly Fire
A bullet to the head would outright kill people most of the time: yet in l4d2 it can take more than that. It shouldn't.

###M60 and Grenade Launcher Can Be Refitted
It makes no sense that you are somehow forbidden from finding additional ammo for these weapons. Sure, it should be rarer, but if you make it possible to find these weapons it is also inherently possible to find some more ammunition for them somewhere!

###Survivor Bots Are Not Stupid
Survivor bots often do very stupid things, like staring at infected who have you pinned for 30 seconds before doing anything about it, or following a jockeyed player around instead of shoving it or shooting it off. They are also afraid of using melee weapons and never even pickup throwables. Sometimes they use health items when they should be saving them. This will be changed to the best of my ability, though I think there's already an addon that greatly improves survivor AI which might save me the work.

###Infected Bots Are Not Stupid
Infected bots also have a tendency to be a bit 'simple.' They tend to just charge in without thinking, or stare at players for a few seconds before attacking (smokers/boomers). Hunters get scared away with a few shots and never wall-pounce. Jockeys just walk in slowly instead of leaping everywhere. Tanks throw rocks at seemingly random times. Hopefully most of these things can be improved.
